Macro Behavioral Targeting
==========================

We investigate a class of emerging online marketing challenges in social networks; macro behavioral targeting (MBT) is introduced as non-personalized broadcasting efforts to massive populations. We propose a new probabilistic graphical model for MBT. Further, a linear-time approximation method is proposed to circumvent an intractable parametric representation of user behaviors. We compare the proposed model with the existing state-of-the-art method on real datasets from social networks. Our model outperforms in all categories by comfortable margins.

Audience & Problem
===========

* **Target audience:** Brand and social media marketers and researchers
* **Problem:** Marketers spend millions every month to acquire Facebook fans
 * *We spent $30M and acquired 20M FB fans. Now what?* – a major US retailer
* **Research question:** How to optimally engage one’s fans so that they stay active and retain their value to the brand?
* FB user => **Fan => Engaged Fan** => Customer





Methodology
===========
